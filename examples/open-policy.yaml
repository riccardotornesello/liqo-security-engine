# Example: Open Communication Policy
#
# This example demonstrates a permissive policy that allows all communication
# between clusters with minimal restrictions.
#
# Use Case:
# - Development environments where security is less critical
# - Trusted cluster peerings within the same organization
# - Initial setup before implementing more restrictive policies
# - Testing connectivity between clusters
#
# Warning: This policy allows unrestricted communication. Use only in trusted
# environments. For production, implement more restrictive policies.
