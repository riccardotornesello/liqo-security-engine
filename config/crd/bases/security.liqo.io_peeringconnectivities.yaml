          PeeringConnectivity is the Schema for the peeringconnectivities API.
          It represents a security policy configuration for controlling network connectivity
          in a Liqo multi-cluster peering scenario. Each PeeringConnectivity resource is
          typically created in a tenant namespace (e.g., liqo-tenant-<cluster-id>) and
          defines firewall rules that control traffic between different resource groups.
